# fourier_sampling
Github repository for SAMSI WG V: Fourier sampling

sim_direct = sampling of the Fourier coefficients
sim_direct_plot_results = plotting results from sim_direct
sim_eval = sampling of the function values
sim_eval_plot_results = plotting results from sim_eval

comp_wts =  computes the weights given the components
samp_sz = computes the number of samples, and sorted gamma values, and estimates of prod weights
