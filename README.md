# fourier_sampling
Github repository for SAMSI WG V: Fourier sampling

sim_direct = sampling of the Fourier coefficients
sim_direct_plot_results = plotting results from sim_direct
sim_eval = sampling of the function values

comp_wts =  computes Fourier coefficients of the true function
samp_sz = computes the number of samples, and sorted gamma values, and estimates of prod weights

sobol_xxx_d.mat = value of the polynomials in dimension d at xxx Sobol points
